# Brain Segmentation with Enhanced U-Net

## Project Overview

This project presents an enhanced U-Net model for brain tumor segmentation in MRI images. The model integrates advanced techniques like attention mechanisms and custom loss functions to improve the accuracy and reliability of automated brain tumor segmentation. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the model's superior performance, achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.87 and a Mean Intersection over Union (MeanIoU) of 0.97.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Platform**: Google Colab for GPU acceleration

## Getting Started

### Set Up the Environment

1. Open the project notebook in Google Colab:
   [Open Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/your-colab-notebook-link)
2. Mount your Google Drive to access datasets and save models:
   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')


## Usage

### Download and Prepare the Dataset

Download the brain tumor segmentation dataset using the Kaggle API by following these steps in Google Colab:

```bash
!pip install kaggle

from google.colab import files
files.upload()  # Upload your kaggle.json file

!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

!kaggle datasets download -d nikhilroxtomar/brain-tumor-segmentation
!unzip brain-tumor-segmentation.zip -d brain_tumor_segmentation
```
### Steps Explained:
- **Install Kaggle API**: First, install the Kaggle API to access datasets.
- **Upload kaggle.json**: Upload your `kaggle.json` file to authenticate your API requests.
- **Setup Kaggle Directory**: Create a directory for the Kaggle configuration file and ensure correct permissions.
- **Download Dataset**: Use the Kaggle API to download the dataset directly into your Colab environment.
- **Unzip Dataset**: Extract the dataset into a specified directory for use in your project.

## Running the Notebook

To train and evaluate the model, follow these steps:

1. **Open the Notebook**: Open the provided Google Colab notebook link.

2. **Execute Cells**: Run the cells sequentially in the notebook. The notebook is structured to guide you through the data loading, model training, evaluation, and visualization processes.

3. **Monitor Training**: Observe the training progress and outputs, including loss and accuracy metrics, as the model processes the brain tumor segmentation dataset.

By following these steps, you will successfully train and evaluate the U-Net model for brain segmentation within the Google Colab environment.

## Model Architecture

The enhanced U-Net model incorporates several key features:

- **Encoder (Contracting Path)**: Captures contextual information using convolutional layers and downsampling.
- **Bottleneck**: Captures abstract features with high-dimensional representations.
- **Decoder (Expansive Path)**: Reconstructs spatial dimensions through upsampling and concatenation with encoder features.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focuses on relevant features to enhance segmentation precision.
- **Custom Loss Function**: Combines weighted binary cross-entropy, Dice coefficient loss, and focal loss.

## Results

### Training and Validation Performance

- **Dice Coefficient**: 0.87
- **MeanIoU**: 0.97
- **Precision**: 0.548
- **Recall**: 0.667
